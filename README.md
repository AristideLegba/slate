# SlateAdmin
The full-screen ExtJS app powering /manage on Slate V1, extracted from SlateFoundation/slate and upgradet to ExtJS 5

## Getting started with development
1. Install latest 5.x Sencha CMD
2. Clone this repository
3. `cd slate-admin/sencha-workspace/packages`
4. `git clone https://github.com/SlateFoundation/slate-admin-theme.git`
5. `cd ../SlateAdmin`
6. `sencha app build`

Then run a web server from `slate-admin/sencha-workspace` or higher in your file tree and navigate to the
`sencha-workspace/SlateAdmin` folder in your browser. If you don't have a server you can run `sencha web start`
to run a basic local server.

The first time you build the app, it will download the correct version of the framework from Sencha.
