# slate

An open-source foundation for schools


## Source code status
Slate was originally built tightly integrated with the pilot school's systems. A standalone release of Slate's core feature set is being prepared and audited in a private repository so that we can ensure no sensitive configuration details or keys make it into the public repository.

Expect an initial version to be available here by April 11
